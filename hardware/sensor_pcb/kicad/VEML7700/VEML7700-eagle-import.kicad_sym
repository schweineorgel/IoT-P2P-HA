Set the \"Maximum Ambient Temperature\" until it reaches TJ (\"Max Junction Temperature\"), which is the absolute limit for safe use of the regulator: http://www.daycounter.com/Calculators/Heat-Sink-Temperature-Calculator.phtml Heat Sink Temperature Calculator\n\nFor example, With 12V source into a 3.3V LP2985 and a 30mA load, we are dissipating (12V-3.3V) * 0.03A = 0.261W.  With a θJA of 206 °C/W, a TJ of 150°C, and 261mW we can safely use the chip without a heat sink up to 75°C (=147.1°C Junction Temperature)."
